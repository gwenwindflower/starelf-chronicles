There's an unresolvable tension between two poles:

- integration, completeness, complexity
- modularity, focus, simplicity

When building tools or systems it's really easy to start getting knotted up in your own threads trying to weave a solution that satisfies (impossibly), both of these poles. The best advice I have at present to start simple and manual. Automate and add complexity as you wear desire paths into your system.

- 🙅🏻‍♀️ **Don't** try to anticipate your needs before you do the work in a non-automated manner for a reasonable amount of time.
- ❌ **Don't** try to solve a need before it arises.
- 🙈 **Don't** spend time envisioning hypothetical future uses for a system.
