## What are _sets_ in python?

`{a, b, c}` sets are _unordered_, you can't access them via index. Also all elements have to be unique and immutable, but the contents of the set are mutable. Unordered. Mutable (with caveats).

Very fast for determining if an element is in a set or doing set operations.

## What are _dictionaries_ in python?

`{key: value, key: value}` objects, hashes, they have many names but it's all key-value pairs inside curly braces.
