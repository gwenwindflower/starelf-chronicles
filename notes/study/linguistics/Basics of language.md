## What is duality of patterning?

- Form: the sounds or hand shapes
- Combination of forms: create meaning not individual sounds
<!--ID: 1672978855599-->


The combination of forms makes meaning, individual sounds or shapes don't contain meaning alone.

## What is arbitrariness of the sign?

Combinations of forms create signs, and these signs are not inherent to the thing they signify. They're arbitrary. Lots of languages can have different signs for the same thing.

A **_sign_** is linguistics is anything that conveys a meaning beyond itself. The word rain and the moisture in the air are both signs of rain, but only the word rain is arbitrary. The moisture is in inherent part of rain. [It can also mean a unit in a signed language like ASL.]

## What is reflexivity?

The ability to use language to talk about language. Emojis unfortunately ðŸ˜­ do not qualify as a language (yet!) because you can't use emojis to discuss the linguistics of emojis.
