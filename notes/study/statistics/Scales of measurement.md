## What are the 4 scales of measurement?

1. **Nominal scale** - categories without hierarchy or order (e.g. eye color)
2. **Ordinal scale** - categories with an order (think groupings of opinion from supportive to hostile of vaccines)
3. **Interval scale** - ratios hold up and averages can be done, but the zero point is arbitrary so while addition and subtraction are meaningful, and thus so are means, multiplication and division can't be done with meaning (think temperatures - zero degrees Celsius is not the absence of temperature it's just an arbitrary point at which water freezes. Thus 20 degrees, while 2 times larger on the scale, isn't 'twice as much temperature'. 50 degrees Celsius is not 25x hotter than 2 degree Celsius, nor 50x hotter than 1 degree Celsius)
4. **Ratio scale** - zero actually means the absence of the thing being measured. (think time: 0s is the absence of elapsed time) This makes multiplication and division meaningful. A 2s response time to a stimulus really is twice as fast as a 4s response time.

## Explain the difference between continuous and discrete variables, then specify which scales of measurement can be continuous

| type     | discrete | continuous |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Nominal  | x        |            |
| Ordinal  | x        |            |
| Interval | x        | x          |
| Ratio    | x        | x          |

1. **Discrete** - can only fit in one category, for instance a test score where answers are all true or false, or categories like eye color.
2. **Continuous** - response time, temperatures, infinite grain in between units. Could always be rounded into discrete though.

## Explain the difference between reliability and validity

- **Reliability** measures how precise our measurement is. Are we measuring with a fine enough grain to be useful? How repeatable and consistent are the results? Our instruments or experimental designs need to be reliable to give us precise measurements.
- **Validity** measures how accurate we are, is the measurement useful in its correspondence to reality.
- Unreliable measurements can make it hard to determine which, if any, of the same measurements of something are valid or accurate, so some people say **reliability is a necessity for validity**.

## What are the 4 main types of reliability?

1. **Test-retest reliability** - does repeating the test over time yield the same results
2. **Inter-rater reliability** - if different experimenters (people) run the test do they get the same results
3. **Parallel forms reliability** - do different versions of the same instrument (like a variety of bathroom scales to measure your weight) yield the same result
4. **Internal consistency reliability** - do the individual parts of a combined result yield consistent answers
