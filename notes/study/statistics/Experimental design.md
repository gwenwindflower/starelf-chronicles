## What is a confound?

A confound is an additional, often unmeasured variable that turns out to be related to both the predictors and the outcomes. The existence of confounds threatens the **internal validity** of the study because you can’t tell whether the predictor causes the outcome, or if the confounding variable causes it.

## What is an artifact?

A result is said to be “artifactual” if it only holds in the special situation that you happened to test in your study. The possibility that your result is an artifact describes a threat to your **external validity**, because it raises the possibility that you can’t generalize your results to the actual population that you care about.
