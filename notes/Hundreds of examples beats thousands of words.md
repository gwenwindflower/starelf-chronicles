The most powerful levels of expertise are beyond the conscious mind, intuition that often can't be explained. Because of this the best way to teach is with _high quality, high quantity **examples**_. Not like 2-3 examples, more like 200-300 in a compressed amount of time.

Libraries of 100s of small examples are powerful for the brain to match patterns and sort the signal of important patterns from the noise of surface concerns.
