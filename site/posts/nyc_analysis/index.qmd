Let's get set up and import our data.
```{python}
# setup oauth for Google BigQuery, put the project we'll be running compute on in a variable
project_id = 'dbt-bq-public-datasets'

import pandas as pd

subway_routes = pd.io.gbq.read_gbq('''
  SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_subway.routes`
''', project_id=project_id)

```


```{python}
subway_routes.head()
```
